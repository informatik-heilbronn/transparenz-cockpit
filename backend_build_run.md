# Building and running the backend
## Prerequisites

### 1. Setup Java JDK 

Running Gradle always requires a Java JDK version 8 or higher. 
For this project it is recommended to use version 11 of the Java JDK.
First [download](https://adoptium.net/de/temurin/releases) the installer for the Java JDK.

####Windows

Make sure you select the appropriate operating system, architecture and version 11 of the JDK.
Download and run the .msi file. Make sure the "Configure JAVA_HOME variable" option is checked. This option is disabled by default in the installer.

After the installation has finished, open CMD and check with `java -version` if the installation was successful.

### 2. Setup Gradle

Gradle is a build tool used to build the backend. Gradle version 7.1 is required for the backend. A list of the different versions can be found [here](https://gradle.org/releases/).
